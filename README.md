# chrome-extension
Here is a chrome extension I have created as a learning project for JavaScript, CSS and HTML. You can install the package and go to chrome extensions page. Once you turn on the developer mode from the switch on top right on that page, click on load unpacked button and choose the project file you have downloaded. Hope you like it as much as I do!
