# chrome-extension

- Here is a chrome extension I have created as a learning project for JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

* You can install the package and go to chrome extensions page.

+ Once you turn on the developer mode from the switch on top right on that page, click on load unpacked button and choose the project file you have downloaded.

- Hope you like it as much as I do!

* Special thanks to Scrimba platform for this coding opportunity!
